Create a Boolean function that returns True if a grade is valid or False if it is not.
In the main program, apply the function by calculating the average of two grades.
FUNCTION:
    validGrade(grade: real): logical

OUTPUT:
    The average of X and Y is Z

Function validGrade(grade: real): logical
Start
    If grade >= = .and. grade <= 10 Then
        return .t.
    Else
        return .f.
    End_if
End

Program ex_function_with_parameter
Var
    grade1, grade2, average: real

Start
    Write "Enter the first grade: "
    Read grade1
    If validGrade(grade1) Then
        Write "Enter the second grade: "
        Read grade2
        If validGrade(grade2) Then
            average = (grade1 + grade2) / 2
            Write "The average of ", grade1, "with", grade2, "is", average
        Else
            Write "Invalid Grade 2"
        End_if
    Else
        Write "Invalid Grade 1"
    End_if
